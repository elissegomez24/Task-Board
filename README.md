# Task Board

A Kanban board for task management.

- **Drag and Drop:** Tasks can be dragged between different status lanes (To Do, In Progress, Done).

  - Yellow if due today or approaching soon.
  - Red if overdue.

2. Click on **Add Task** to open the modal and enter task details.
3. Drag tasks between lanes to update their status.
4. Tasks update automatically in local storage.
